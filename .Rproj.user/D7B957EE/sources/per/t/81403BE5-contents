\indent 1. Side effects of Avandia  

Rosiglitazone is the active ingredient in the controversial type~2 diabetes medicine Avandia and has been linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as stroke, heart failure, and death. A common alternative treatment is pioglitazone, the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos. In a nationwide retrospective observational study of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged  65 years or older, it was found that 2,593 of the 67,593 patients using rosiglitazone and 5,386 of the 159,978 using pioglitazone had serious cardiovascular problems. These data are summarized in the contingency table below.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll  cc c} 
								&				& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Cardiovascular problems}} \\
\cline{3-4}	
								&				& Yes 	& No 		& Total	\\
\cline{2-5}
\multirow{2}{*}{\textit{Treatment}}		& Rosiglitazone 	& 2,593	& 65,000		& 67,593 	\\
								& Pioglitazone		& 5,386 	& 154,592 	& 159,978\\
\cline{2-5}
								&Total			& 7,979	& 219,592		& 227,571
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Determine if each of the following statements is true or false. If false, explain why. \textit{Be careful:} The reasoning may be wrong even if the statement's conclusion is correct. In such cases, the statement should be considered false.


a. Since more patients on pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems (5,386 vs. 2,593), we can conclude that the rate of cardiovascular problems for those on a pioglitazone treatment is higher.
b. The data suggest that diabetic patients who are taking rosiglitazone are more likely to have cardiovascular problems since the rate of incidence was (2,593 / 67,593 = 0.038) 3.8\% for patients on this treatment, while it was only (5,386 / 159,978 = 0.034) 3.4\% for patients on pioglitazone.
c. The fact that the rate of incidence is higher for the rosiglitazone group proves that rosiglitazone causes serious cardiovascular problems.
d. Based on the information provided so far, we cannot tell if the difference between the rates of incidences is due to a relationship between the two variables or due to chance.

\indent 2. Heart transplants  

In the Stanford Heart Transplant Study, of the 34 patients in the control group, 4 were alive at the end of the study. Of the 69 patients in the treatment group, 24 were alive. The contingency table below summarizes these results.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll  cc c} 
							&		& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Group}} \\
\cline{3-4}
							&		& Control 	& Treatment 	& Total	\\
\cline{2-5}
							& Alive 	& 4	 	& 24			& 28 	\\
\raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{\emph{Outcome}} & Dead	& 30		& 45	 		& 75\\
\cline{2-5}
							& Total	& 34		& 69			& 103
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



a. What proportion of patients in the treatment group and what proportion of patients in the control group died?  

One approach for investigating whether or not the treatment is effective is to use a randomization technique.  

b. What are the claims being tested? Use the same null and alternative hypothesis notation used in the section.  

c.  The paragraph below describes the set up for such approach, if we were to do it without using statistical software. Fill in the blanks with a number or phrase, whichever is appropriate.

\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{2em}
We write \textit{alive} on \rule{1cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were alive at the end of the study, and \textit{dead} on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were not. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them into two groups: one group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing treatment, and another group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing control. We calculate the difference between the proportion of \textit{dead} cards in the treatment and control groups (treatment - control) and record this value. We repeat this many times to build a distribution centered at \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. Lastly, we calculate the fraction of simulations where the simulated differences in proportions are \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. If this fraction is low, we conclude that it is unlikely to have observed such an outcome by chance and that the null hypothesis should be rejected in favor of the alternative.
\end{adjustwidth}

Perform a simulation and use results to decide the effectiveness of the transplant program.

```{r results='hide',echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
set.seed(7220)
heart <- data.frame(outcome =c(rep('Alive', 28), rep('Dead', 75)), group = c(rep(c('Control', 'Treatment'), c(4, 24)), rep(c('Control', 'Treatment'), c(30, 45))))

heart <- heart %>%
sample() %>%
select(-orig.id)
write_csv(heart,"data/Stanford_heart_study.csv")
```



d.  Read in data from "data/Stanford_heart_study.csv"  
e.  Find observed value

f. Simulate 1000 values by using `shuffle` on group.

g. Plot distribution of results.  

h. Find p-value.

i. Decide if you think ....
