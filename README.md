# Advanced-Probability-and-Statistics
Notes for Math 377

We developed these notes for Math 377 to make the course a more modern take on statistics and probability. This means we have more computational statistics such as simulation, permuations, and bootstrap.

The first block is on data collection and data summary. It is based heavily on the Openintro book Introduction to Statistics with Randomization and Simulation, https://www.openintro.org/book/isrs/

The second block is probability with an emohasis in using computational methods instead of traditional algebraic symbol manipulation.  

The third block is inference with traditional small sample normal-based methods as well as computational methods such as randomization and the bootstrap.  

The last block is statistical modeling using regression. We end on a quick overview of logistic regression.

This course is a perfect lead into machine learning ideas.
