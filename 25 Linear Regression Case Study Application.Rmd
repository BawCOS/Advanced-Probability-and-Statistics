# Exercises


\indent 1. HFI   

Choose another freedom variable and a variable you think would strongly
    correlate with it. 
    
a. Produce a scatterplot of the two variables.  
b. Fit a linear model. At a glance, does there seem to be a linear relationship?
c. How does this relationship compare to the relationship between 
    `pf_expression_control` and `pf_score`? Use the $R^2$ values from the two 
    model summaries to compare. Does your independent variable seem to predict
    your dependent one better? Why or why not?
d. Display
    the model diagnostics for the regression model analyzing this relationship.
