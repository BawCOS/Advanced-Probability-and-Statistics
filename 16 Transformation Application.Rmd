# Exercises

\indent 1. Let $X$ be a random variable and let $g$ be a function. By this point, it should be clear that $\E[g(X)]$ is not necessarily equal to $g(\E[X])$. Give one example (excluding examples from the Lesson 13 narrative) of $X$ and $g$ where $\E[g(X)] \neq g(\E[X])$. What are $\E[g(X)]$ and $g(\E[X])$? Use `R` to find $\E[g(X)]$.

\indent 2. (From Pruim 2011, Section 2.5) Let $X\sim \textsf{Binom}(n,\pi)$. What is the pmf for $X+3$? Make sure you specify the domain of $Y$. [Note, in Lesson 8, we used $p$ for the probability of success in a binomial distribution. In the Pruim text, $\pi$ was used.]

\indent 3. Let $X\sim \textsf{Expon}(\lambda)$. Let $Y=X^2$. Find the pdf of $Y$. 


&nbsp;

\indent 4. ADVANCED: In exercise 3, you found the pdf of $Y=X^2$ when $X\sim \textsf{Expon}(\lambda)$. Rearrange the pdf to show that $Y\sim \textsf{Weibull}$ and find the parameters of that distribution.
